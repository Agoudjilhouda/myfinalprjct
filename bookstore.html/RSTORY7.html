                        TWO FRIENDS. TEN SUMMER TRIPS.
THEIR LAST CHANCE TO FALL IN LOVE. 

12 SUMMERS AGO: Poppy and Alex meet. They hate each other, and are pretty confident they'll never speak again. 

11 SUMMERS AGO: They're forced to share a ride home from college and by the end of it a friendship is formed. And a pact: every year, one vacation together. 

10 SUMMERS AGO: Alex discovers his fear of flying on the way to Vancouver. Poppy holds his hand the whole way. 

7 SUMMERS AGO: They get far too drunk and narrowly avoid getting matching tattoos in New Orleans. 

2 SUMMERS AGO: It all goes wrong. 

THIS SUMMER: Poppy asks Alex to join her on one last trip. A trip that will determine the rest of their lives.
