                <h2>Description</h2>
                <h5>"My cheeks hurt from smiling through this delightful book for adults who haven't outgrown fairytales." - JODI PICOULT, THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF WISH YOU WERE HERE

                    "By the Book is in my hands and I could not be any more excited to celebrate it!" - EMILY HENRY, THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF BOOK LOVERS
                    
                    Sometimes to truly know a person, you have to read between the lines.
                    
                    Isabelle is completely lost. When she first began her career in publishing after college, she did not expect to be twenty-five, still living at home, and one of the few Black employees at her publishing house. Overworked and underpaid, constantly torn between speaking up or stifling herself, Izzy thinks there must be more to this publishing life. So when she overhears her boss complaining about a beastly high-profile author who has failed to deliver his long-awaited manuscript, Isabelle sees an opportunity to finally get the promotion she deserves.
                    
                    All she has to do is go to the author's Santa Barbara mansion and give him a pep talk or three. How hard could it be?
                    
                    But Izzy quickly finds out she is in over her head. Beau Towers is not some celebrity lightweight writing a tell-all memoir. He is jaded and withdrawn and - it turns out - just as lost as Izzy. But despite his standoffishness, Izzy needs Beau to deliver, and with her encouragement, his story begins to spill onto the page. They soon discover they have more in common than either of them expected, and as their deadline nears, Izzy and Beau begin to realize there may be something there that wasn't there before. 
                    
                    Best-selling author Jasmine Guillory's reimagining of a beloved fairy tale is a romantic triumph of love and acceptance and learning that sometimes to truly know a person you have to read between the lines.</h5>
